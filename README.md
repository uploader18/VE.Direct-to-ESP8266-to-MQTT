# VE.Direct-to-ESP8266-to-MQTT
Module to connect Victron BMV to MQTT.
For now this is not a fully working code since it stops sometimes after a few second and other times after a few days. Use it at your own risk

Parts of code are taken from this page and are NOT mine.

I will be updating and writing code for this project WHEN I have time to do it.
